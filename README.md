 The main file is the jupyter notebook file: urn_code.ipynb inside the urn_python_code folder. This file uses the functions from the other python files to produce the plots in the paper and also .txt files that are generated using  urn_binary_search.cpp and pure_birth_process.cpp, C++ files that are in the urn_C++_code folder. These .txt files are in the folders output and output_bp within urn_C++_code. We also note that for the discrete feedback model we use the binary search tree explained in Appendix B of
